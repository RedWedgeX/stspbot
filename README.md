# Badgy - STSP's Discord Bot

## But... why?
- It's a Discord bot!
- It's Badgey!
- It was built for Star Trek Shitposting's Discord Server!
- It manages:
    - #welcome channel handling
    - Self-assigning roles (TODO)
    

## How does it work?
- It's a Bot based on Discord.py library
- It needs an environmental variable called `TOKEN` with the Discord bot token
